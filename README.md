● Reduced the dimensionality of a sonar dataset containing 60+ features by performing Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) before fitting the PCA transformed features to a Multi-Layered Perceptron (MLP) classification model.
● Achieved a test accuracy of 90.47% by making use of 11 principal components (PCA transformed features) that were 
trained on a MLP classification model having 100 hidden layers.
